# Stock Monitoring MVP

## Purpose

The purpose of the application is to use React and Typescript to search for a stock and return a chart based on the ticker symbol entered.

## Long term vision (technology)

The long term vision is to use React/Typescript on the front end and Express/NodeJS on the backend. I intend to incorporate GraphQL if it makes sense to do so.

## Long term goals

- Ping authentication for individual user access
- Grab news of ticker from one or multiple API's
- Include transitions between pages and ticker chart changes
- Implement 90%+ testing code coverage
